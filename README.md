The main advantage of this useSWRMutation hook is, all the useSWR hooks with the same key will be re-validated automatically as a side effect. For example, letâ€™s assume there is a component using useSWR with the key /todo to render the Todo list. And using useSWRMutation with the key /todo to add a new Todo item.

NextJS14 caches per fetch and for Route handlers (api routes) it caches for GET if it doesn't use the request object, cookies or header
so you need to add: export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
